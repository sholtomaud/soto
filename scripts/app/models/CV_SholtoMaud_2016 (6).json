Hydstra is largely a surface water system. At Arrow we attempted to modify Hydstra to accommodate hydrogeological data used for monitoring the compliance of Coal Seam Gas operations. Ultimately the differences in Data Models and release cycle of the Hydstra system presented significant ongoing challenges to the project. These challenges motivated me to undertake my PhD research into the application of BigData systems to alleviate the problem."},{"company":"Kisters Pty Ltd","position":"Systems Engineer","website":"https://www.kisters.com.au","startDate":"2010-05-01","endDate":"2012-06-01","summary":"My time with Kisters Pty Ltd was a highly valuable experience, with a small group of very skilled people in a production environment.
